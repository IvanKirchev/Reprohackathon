# This project presents a bioinformatic workflow for analysis of the genetic determinants of uveal melanoma (cancer of the eye).
Inspired by this article https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/Supplement_1/i11/7210451#409576445
it attempts to reanalysis the following two papers https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23313955 and https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23861464
with the main forcus being on REPRODUCABILITY and other valuable software practices (versioning, code collaboration, documentationm etc.)

intron vs exon: exons are conserved in the process of creating mature mRNA while introns are removed during RNA splicing
