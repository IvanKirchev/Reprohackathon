# This project presents a bioinformatic workflow for analysis of the genetic determinants of uveal melanoma (cancer of the eye).
Inspired by this article https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/Supplement_1/i11/7210451#409576445
it attempts to reanalysis the following two papers https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23313955 and https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23861464
with the main forcus being on REPRODUCABILITY and other valuable software practices (versioning, code collaboration, documentationm etc.)


# Below is the software stack planed to be used as of right now:
  - Nextflow: Data pipeline management on DSLv2
  - Docker: containerization
  - Git: version control
